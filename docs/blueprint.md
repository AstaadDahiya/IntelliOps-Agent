# **App Name**: IntelliOps Agent

## Core Features:

- Alert Reception: Receive alerts from SuperOps via webhook.
- Alert Analysis: Analyze alerts using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to extract key information and context.
- Contextual Knowledge Retrieval: Use a tool that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant solutions from the knowledge base based on the analyzed alert.
- Action Determination: Decide on the appropriate course of action (e.g., run a script, deploy a patch, escalate) based on the alert analysis and knowledge retrieval. Make decisions using generative AI.
- Action Execution: Execute the decided action using the SuperOps API.
- Logging and Monitoring: Log all actions taken and monitor the system's performance and effectiveness.
- Alert Display: Display the analyzed alert, proposed actions, and their execution status in a clear, easy-to-understand format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#663399) to evoke a sense of intelligence, security, and operational efficiency.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and professional look, providing a high contrast to the main elements.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to highlight important actions and status updates, providing a visual cue for key information.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for headings and titles. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for body text and descriptions. 'Space Grotesk' will give a modern, tech-oriented feel while maintaining readability. 'Inter' will ensure comfortable reading for longer texts.
- Use clear, functional icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent alert types, actions, and status indicators.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with clear separation of concerns, using cards or panels to group related information.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., progress bars, loading spinners) to provide visual feedback on system activity without being distracting.
